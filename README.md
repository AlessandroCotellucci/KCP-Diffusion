# CPKP Diffusion on a network
Implementation on a network of the model for the diffusion of CPKP proposed in the article (Transmission Dynamics of Carbapenemase-Producing
Klebsiella Pneumoniae and Anticipated Impact of Infection Control Strategies in a Surgical Unit) with some change.
The model implemented allow also the contagion between HCW. The model is based on a HCW cluster each HCW node has a fixed number of patient.
